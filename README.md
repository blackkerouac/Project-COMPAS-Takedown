# Project-COMPAS-Takedown

About:
With a lot of court systems using the COMPAS algorithm, bias comes easy. We begged the question can we create an AI algorithm that proved the algorithm is biased and shouldn't be used to determine if a person will recommit a crime. 
In our project we try to test to see if we can train/compare COMPAS systems to see if it can accurately predict if a person practice recidivism.
